__________________Opening and Closing____________________
The first thing to do when you are working with files in Python isto open thefile. When you open the files, you can specify with parameters how you want to open them. 
The "r" is for reading, the "w" for writing and the "a" for appending.

This opens the filename for reading. 

By default, the file is opened with the "r" parameter. 
fh = open("filename_here", "r")

This opens the fhe file for writing. 

It will create the file if it doesn't exist, and if it does, it will overwrite
it.
fh =open("filename_here", "w")

This opens the fhe file in appending mode. 

That means, it will be open for writing and everything will be written to the
end of the file.
fh =open("filename_here", "a")

#This closes the file and is used when the program doesn't need it more. 
fh.close()


_____________________Reading and Writting ______________________

###Reading from file
Functions available for reading the files: read, readline and readlines. 
 
-----Read---
The read function reads all characters (unless you specify other)
eg.
    fh = open("filename", "r")
    content = fh.read()

---Readline---
The readline function reads a single line from the file
eg.
   fh = open("filename", "r")
   content = fh.readline()

----Readlines----
The readlines function returns a list containing all the lines of data in the
file.The readlines function reads all rows and retains the newlines character that is
at the end of every row.
eg.
fh = open("filename", "r")
content = fh.readlines()
print content.rstrip() 
print content[:-1]

### Writting from files
The functions for writing are write and writelines

---Write---
To write a fixed sequence of characters to a file
eg.
   fh = open("hello.txt","w")
   write("Hello World")

----Writeline----
With the writeline function you can write a list of strings to a file
eg.
   fh = open("hello.txt", "w")
   lines_of_text = ["a line of text", "another line of text", "a third line"]
   fh.writelines(lines_of_text)
