_______________________DATA STRUCTURES________________________

Python offers  5  different types of data structure.

1. ARRAY:
Array refers to a named list of finite number n of similar data elelments. Each of the data elements can be referenced respectively
by a set of consecutive numbers, usually 0,1,2,3,4 . . .  n .
eg.
    A array ar containing 10 elements will be referenced as
   ar[0],ar[1] ,ar[2] . . . ar[9]

2. STACKS:
Stacks data structure refer to list stored and accessed in a special way,
where LIFO(Last In First Out) technique is followed.In stack insertion and deletion take place at only one end called the top.

3. QUEUES:
Queues data structure are FIFO(First In First Out ) lists , where 
take place at "rear" end of queue deletions take place at the "front" end
of the queue.

4. LINKED LIST:
Linked lists are special list of some data elements linked to one another.
The logical ordering is represented by having each element pointing to 
next element.Each element is called a 'node' which has tho parts.
The INFO part which stores the information and the reference pointer part
i.e stores reference of next element.

5.Trees:
Trees are multilevel data structures having a hierarchical relationship amongs 
its element called 'node'. Topmost node is called node of the tree and bottom
most node of tree is called leaves of tree. Each node have some 3:59 PM 12/12/2016reference pointerspointing to node below it.
